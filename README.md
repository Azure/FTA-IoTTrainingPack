# IoT Production Training Kit

The IoT Production Training Kit contains a collection of examples and best practices to address common IoT use cases and challenges. The content is a combination of experiences from Microsoft teams and learnings from customer engagements.

The IoT Production Training Kit can help you to implement best practices, use the Azure IoT service which fits best to your scenario and to avoid common pitfalls when implementing IoT projects using Microsoft Azure IoT.

The IoT Production Training Kit is modular so you can jump to any section of interest or start at the beginning. The slides, demos and source code for each module are shared with a creative commons (with attribution) license to help your organization build effective IoT solutions With Azure IoT.

## Overview

A typical IoT scenario consists of: 

* IoT devices
* Field gateways
* A cloud gateway (edge based processing and storing capabilities)
* Cloud based processing and storage capabilities

* [Certificates](README.md): This module covers ...
* [IoT Edge](IoT-Edge-101/iot-edge-101.md): This module covers ...
* [Data Egress](DataEgress-101-Routing/README.md): This module covers multiple ways to egress data from IoT Hub

  * [IoT Hub Routes](DataEgress-101-Routing/README.md) provides and overview and gives best practices how IoT Hub's data routing functionality can be used to ***push*** data to other Azure PaaS services like Service Bus, Event Hubs or Azure Storage. It highlights how messages ingested to IoT Hub can be enriched and how messages can be filtered.
    * [Event Grid integration](README.md): Will be provided soon
    * [Service Endpoints](README.md): Will be provided soon
* [DevOps]: This module covers ...
  * [DevOps for IoT Hub](README.md): This module covers ...
  * [DevOps for IoT Central](README.md): This module covers ...
