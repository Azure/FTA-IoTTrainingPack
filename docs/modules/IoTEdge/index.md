# IoT Edge 101

Azure IoT Edge provides edge computing capabilities to provide edge
intelligence to your IoT solutions. The following document is a
compilation of the existing Azure IoT Edge documentation, references,
and concepts. This document was created with the assumption of no
previous experience and focuses to ease the understanding around Azure
IoT Edge and facilitate the journey to production for IoT architects,
developers, and operators.

## IoT Edge:

  * [IoT Concepts](iot-concepts.md): covers common concepts and definitions to get up to speed with IoT solutions language.
  * [What is Azure IoT Edge](what-is-iot-edge.md): get a closer look to the capabilities and scenarios where you can use Azure IoT Edge.
  * [Create and manage IoT Edge devices](create-and-manage.md): covers considerations and provides pointers to further documentation to allow you to ask important questions so you can make correct choices for production scenarios.
