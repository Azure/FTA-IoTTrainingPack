# IoT Edge 101

Azure IoT Edge provides edge computing capabilities to provide edge
intelligence to your IoT solutions. The following document is a
compilation of the existing Azure IoT Edge documentation, references,
and concepts. This document was created with the assumption of no
previous experience and focuses to ease the understanding around Azure
IoT Edge and facilitate the journey to production for IoT architects,
developers, and operators.

If you already have experience with IoT Edge concepts and architecture,
and you are looking for more production grade guidance, you can jump
directly to the “[Create and manage IoT Edge devices](/modules/IoTEdge/create-and-manage.md)” section.
