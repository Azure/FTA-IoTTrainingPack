# DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently, reliably, and at scale. DevOps involves a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams, automation of processes, and the use of tools to streamline development, testing, and deployment.

DevOps is increasingly being used in modern software development to increase efficiency, speed up delivery, and improve quality. According to the 2020 State of DevOps report, organizations that have adopted DevOps practices see benefits such as:

- 200 times more frequent deployments
- 24 times faster recovery times
- 3 times lower change failure rate
- 2,555 times faster lead time from commit to deploy

## Philosophy and Approach

DevOps is not a specific tool or technology, but rather a philosophy or approach to software development and delivery. DevOps emphasizes the importance of:

- Automation
- Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
- Testing
- Monitoring
- Feedback

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as code (IAC) is a key component of devops. It refers to the process of managing and provisioning IT infrastructure using code and configuration files, rather than manual processes or tools. IAC enables developers and operators to use the same tools and languages to define, deploy, and update infrastructure resources. IAC can also improve consistency, scalability, and security of the infrastructure.
